# arandr-autoconfig
This script monitors `xrandr` outputs' status and launches scripts, expectedly as generated by `arandr` utility.

## Requirements
- `python3`
- see `requirements.txt`

## Expected environment
- `~/.screenlayout` folder should contain scripts which will be run once a new output event (connected or disconnected) occurs
- these scripts should be named `<output-a>[[_<output-b>]...].sh` where outputs' names are sorted
  - best is to see what the script actually tries to execute when an event occurs
